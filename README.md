CS 325 was Oregon State University's Analysis of Algorithms course.

For this project, I wrote a simple Python script that solved a maze-like puzzle passed to it as a list of lists that encoded a space filled with barriers.

The object of the puzzle was to find the shortest past between two given points, taking those barriers into account.

Run this script with:

```
python2 Puzzle.py
```
